[508] Emote ID's
----------------

	These are the ID's of almost every working emote (with the exception of ones I've missed, this is tiring)

	Created by Carnage, or, King Lingerz on Rune-Server

KEY:

'No idea'    = I don't know what this emote is.
'Crippled'   = Doesn't work or isn't human. (For example NPC's emotes are different to players)
'Nothing'    = This emote makes your character freeze or stand still.

	     They start at 744 because the other one released for Silab Servers has the rest.

	     It's 744, all the way to 10025.
